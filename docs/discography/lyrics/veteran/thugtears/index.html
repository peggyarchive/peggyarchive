<center><h3 style="color:white">All I need is rest,
I am uncontested,
How can I confess this,
Watch how I finesse.
How you so invested,
This can't be your best cuz,
I am not impressed.
Bullets through my body,
I'm a different shotty,
You my favorite mess.
Bitch I'm never pressed.
Keep fresh bic,
Ride down 86,
Hit!
Roll deep like the kettt,
Bitch I'm "Smoke",
Too fly in the whip,
Hit!
Fake news,
We ain't pressed,
Is it ain't safe now,
Got my trey pound,
In case a pig wanna test,
YEET! (Work)
I'm bout YEET ON THESE NIGGAS! (Work hard...)
Work hard,
Twerk hard,
26, no kids, yea!
Talk shit back it up,
No fades,
Throw shade,
Whole game
Look a damn mess,
Aye Fuck the caping,
No stress,
I'm vexed,
What the fuck my appearance,
I keep a ratchet,
I like m yes julez moaning,
Like a actress,
Ain't got no standards,
I'm kinda passive,
Rich swann,
We gon cash-in,
Dust off the ratchets,
We got some action,
I'm on the main line,
I'm tryna catch em,
I wish a nigga, I would a nigga test,
I wish go against me,
Ima thug I dot play with no rap beef,
Fuck round end up on backtreet,
I don't cried so many times.....
Look...
I wish
WOOSHH!!!
I wish a nigga I would a nigga test,
I wish go against me,
Ima thug I dot play with no rap beef,
Fuck round end up on backtreet,
I don't cried so many times,
I done did so many crimes,
No time, y'all gassed for the new line,
Ugh.
I'll make a nigga cry at his own pad,
I'll make a nigga cry for his dead dad,
I'll make a nigga for his fat wife,
I'll make a nigga cry for me,
I'll make a nigga cry for himself.<center></h3>
