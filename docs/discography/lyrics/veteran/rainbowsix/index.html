<center><h3 style="color:white">[Bridge: Yung Midpack]
Boolin on the block with the glow cocked
And you snow I got the straight drop (X4)
[Verse 1: Yung Midpck]
Pull up on yo block with the pistol
slap you up nigga little boy juts dismiss you
I don't give a fuck right punch its official
I don't give little nigga you need tissue
For your fucking face
Cause it's full of the blood
Blood Bloody Bloody Bloody Bloody Bloody Blood
Smack you fucking up
Nigga I take a stub
Grab you fucking up nigga
Put you in the trunk
Vertically nigga I take you to the dump
Me nigga I --
[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
What you niggas Want!
Got that thang in the trunk!
What you nigga need!
Pills
Crack
Dope
Weed
[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna hit em with the K (Lord forgive me I'm sorry!)
I don't wanna hit em with the K (Hit em all in the body!)
I'ma have to go and be the badman
Baby I'm put him in his place
I'ma have to do it to you baby (I just Caught another body!)
I'ma have to give him something 'mazing (Hit em all in the body!)
Tell it when ya to my baby
[Bridge: JPEGMAFIA]
Coolin on the block with the glow cocked
And you know I got the straight drop (X4)
[Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
It's the you alt-right menace
What a pistol to a penant
Treat a writer like a peasant nigga huh
surface level niggas never get it
fuck a rating and a cynic 
always talking never living nigga huh
I don't make no music for these niggas
Say they wanna be a critic but they cannot take no critism huh
Nigga we the junkies they the dealers
I be rapping
they be triggered
You be writing
I'm a killer
Nigga What!
Fuck is this song?
Fuck is my whip!
Fuck up your streams!
I got the rips!
Skinny and paid!
I'm Taylor Swift!
We at your job
Catch you on shift
Nigga you gone...
I don't like you..
Niggas don't want it..
[Chorus]
Lord forgive me I'm sorry
Hit em all in the body
Lord forgive me I'm sorry
I just caught another body
Hit em all in the body
I had to get some money
[Outro]
I don't wanna be alone
It's so hard for me to trust you baby
I'm around you baby
I got so much on me
40 I'd drown you baby
I don't wanna drown you baby
I just wanna love you baby
I got too much for me
Oh my god so ??
???? I'm lonely<center></h3>
