<center><h3 style="color:white">Peggy, where you been at?
Getting all this promo,
When it comes to money, bet these niggas is a no-show,
I been out in Bed-Stuy,
Chilling with my feet up,
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us,
When I say "us", bet,
I don't mean no fucking crew,
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes & Goofy Troop,
Catch me out in Barksdale,
Counting fettuccine,
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T,
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville,
Strapped with a Kimber,
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder,
Now I'm at the White House,
Looking for your President,
Hop out the van pointing guns at your residence,
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now,
Showing y'all a body,
Hoping that you pussy ass crackers try and find me,
Chains on my body,
Looking like a rapper,
Acting like a slave when I’m gunning for my masters, nigga!
Fuck these niggas!
Buck these niggas!
It’s ironic you pressed for a cooking,
It’s ironic you talk jail time, but you ain’t never seen no central
booking,
It’s ironic you hang with a nigga that beat women,
And have the nerve to call yourself "Girl Pusher",
Wow!
(You ain’t real...
I’m gonna show you how I really feel...)
WHITE BOY BETTER PUT HIS HANDS UP!
I’m ready...
And I’m getting Wilder,
Shoutout to Deontay,
Country niggas booming Peggy, I’m the new Beyoncé,
Devil on my entrée,
Cut like Dante,
Promise I will never go blonde like Ka- (hold up!)
Promise I will never go blonde like Kanye?!
Got so many styles, they should call me Peggy A.J,
When I hit the stage, niggas know it’s a payday,
Tell yo bitch, "Come here!"
Like I work for Midway, nigga!
(Fuck!)
Hot like fire...<center></h3>
