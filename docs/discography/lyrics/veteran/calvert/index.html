If you out there in the 6,
Suck a dick,

And I'm really with the shits,
So u not gon' take my hits,
Break my heart while I break your bitch,
Two black cards let me cloak wrist,
Fuck a diss,

I don't care, bout your fuck, status,
Peggy got no fear!
Jugg and I come with them bands aye,
Gun do not come with plan aye,
Keep a Kimber at the pad aye,
Crackers never get a pass wait,
Credit like my name was chad aye,
Watch who fucking tag babe,
Ok get yo demo out my face,

Tryna give that dick to Kelly Conway,
Pull my case,
Boy I beat that shit like Lennon beat his bae,
Young o shea,
I need a bitch with long hair like Myke C Town,
You talking shit,

You catch a beat down,
I know u never in the hood or in the streets now,
And still I'm hearing that u really want some beef now?
Bruh?
Take your tree out my backwood,
Made the beat cuz I'm that good,
Got your girl on her hands,
Johnny 5 with the cans,
Fuck blog, Fuck a fan,
Hope my record panned,
Least I made u niggas dance,
Fuck 12 nigga stamp!<center></h3>
