<center><h3 style="color:white">I got my hands face like McCaluay culkin,
Gave her the cig but I left smoking,
And it’s the same dude,
Black pants brown boots Chest open,
I traveled down the back again,
My girls golden,
Black man white fam,
I feel like Jason Jordan,
I play my albums front to back,
It make it feel important,
Apply compression when I spit so It don’t get distorted,
Piper Chap,
With the strap,
Fuck the talk,
Get the warden,
I think I'm Rick n morty in the lab I take precaution,
Snipe out em out burn the body,
Stash the gloc,
Buy the coffin,
Just for me,
Yo style is my custody,
Man I should charge a shipping fee,
These rappers don't mean shit to me,
2 guns molder and skully I'm solving mysteries,
Feminist pistol whip your w--- first that's chivalry,
Sounding like my minimes,
But u ain't got the heart to do these evil deeds,
Debra pack,
Turn stone cold into simple Steve,
Where it at,
Slap a nigga up,
Then I get the cream,
5 buck for 6 cookies,
Sounding like a deal to me,
Gots to keep it real for me,
Yo shit to appeal don't to me,
My fans going heel for me,
Shouldn't even be on no bills with me,
These punk niggas be killing,
This wack shit ain't trill me,
Fuck yall niggas I take the heat!<center></h3>
