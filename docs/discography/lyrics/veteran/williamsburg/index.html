<center><h3 style="color:white">Selling art to these yuppies,
Getting mixed offers,
Im In New York like I’m Peter Parker Wrote a hot 16 then I tossed it,
If I wanted bullshit,
I’d just read gawker,
Young rick murder,
I just shoot walkers,
I’m a slave to this rap shit I can’t quit,
Fresh sig with grip,
A yuppie pop shit,
Called the gun Britney jean,
When the spears come out,
I hit you and JT,
U yuppies ain’t real,
Let u live for a fee,
We taking Brooklyn back,
You can leave the coffee,
And you coons dying to,
Word to Charles Barkley,
My head dreaded up like my name mar...
Naw we don’t do that,
Simple rhyming ass niggas,
Get they wig pushed back,
Get your mic snatched,
Nicotine patched,
Call my white boys up,
Get your life hacked,
Heard your Stock dropped,
Nigga this the blow back,
Put the Hawkeyes on him,
Heard he like mash,
You gon’ rust in peace,
Heard you like thrash,
Put a price on your head,
That’s a light bag,
45 on me like mike back,
Whoa,
Hey! Alright!
Baby I’m just heating up,
I just wonder is it for you,
Feelings stuck,
You know how to heat me up,
Ice it up,
Ice it like a hockey puck,
Baby I’m just heating up..
You know how to heat me up..
Deep off in the main..
Hidden hills!
I walk in the booth like I own,
I know that I belong there,
These days ain’t the same,
All ain’t built like that,
These fuck niggas ain’t ____
Like that.
Y’all niggas yall built like rats, ahhh!<center></h3>
