<center><h3 style="color:white">Gone with the sauce,
Got the 45 tucked In the bag,
Hit Em with the hawk,
Naw fuck it dawg,
Whip Em wit the strap,
Ive been on the fucking road
I just ended rock n roll,
We been running up the score,
Turnt your house into a home,
Ugh
I don't fucking Rome,
All I do is count the cash,
Bitch in coming in your house,
Let's get freaky with strap,
We don't fuck with alt right,
Y'all ain't never been a threat,
If y'all come to Baltimore we gonna stick for there racks,
We gon' beat them crackers dead,
We gon' fuck up on they ....
Take em for a ride,
More.. hits
More..life
Tight grip on the chopper,
That kickback light...
Put hands on a blogger,
Make em beg for his life,
Gone with the sauce,
Got the 45 tucked In the bag,
Hit Em with the hawk,
Naw fuck it dawg,
Whip Em wit the strap,
Ive been on the fucking road,
I just ended rock n roll,
We been running up the score man...
I say that pussies off the richter,
No shitting,
Man fuck that bitch,
Man fuck yo baby sitter,
I hit her,
I took her to a showman what's the issue,
I spilt her,
This groovy nigga banging on your sister,
The kicker,
I can't read,
How many cars does it take..
To make this shit an easy race..
How many cars does it take,
To make this fucking pain go away.<center></h3>
