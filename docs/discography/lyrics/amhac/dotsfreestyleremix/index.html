<center><h3 style="color:white">I stuff a gloc in my bitch pocket,
Bitch stop it,
Skinny nigga
Big papi,
We put the pedal to metal,
Iʼma Nicki Minaj it,
1 deep baby,
Canʼt top it,
5ʼ9 with a stick i look like big papi,
I keep a shotti,
bottom bitch will not harm me,
How could I not be,
Everything you copy,
I killed rock,
now Iʼm sending bullets at your zombies,
You never haunt me,
Niggas try to Vietnam me,
But I been playing with pistols,
Since you watching toonami,
Iʼm not rapper,
Iʼm white trash in a mocha body,
Ainʼt no career Iʼm just hoping Madonna adopts me,
I get it popping,
Fuck rock bump poppy,
I put the stock in,
Iʼm scheming Iʼm not plotting,
These niggas stepping to me,
End up Gianna Versaced,
Do a feature for what?
Bro,
I been dying to kick it,
Iʼm to big for my bridges,
Iʼm to rich for these bitches,
Rich in spirit,
Not in wealth,
Again do a feature for what,
And you know that Iʼm afraid of everything,
Written like a ghost,
Stuck behind the wind,
And you know that Iʼm a fool,
With the thing,
Written like a ghost in the wind.
Make me cry nigga i'm bout to fuckin cry<center></h3>
