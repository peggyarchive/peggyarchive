<center><h3 style="color:white">If itʼs good then itʼs good break it down that shit out of my hands,
I feel annoyed,
Iʼm feeling strange,
I feel the gains,
I fill a void,
Im still a roach,
Im doing shows,
I feel employed,
Even though Iʼm koi,
And u know that boi,
I still feel the same,
I feel afraid,
This easy A
Im feeling framed,
I wear a mask,
I see the Banes,
I feel ashamed,
Even though the aim,
Is crazy mane,
Feel like Iʼm losing hoping,
Iʼm on the web,
I net the gross,
I see the growth,
I feel engaged,
Iʼm in the game,
Donʼt need a coach,
But I really do,
Naw I really donʼt,
I just been in my head,
Iʼm getting fried,
Iʼm on the side,
Iʼm Kevin fed,
I played with fire,
I canʼt retire,
I need the bread,
Stat,
Donʼt rely on the strength of my image,
Hey!
If its good then its good,
break it down,
that shit is out of my hands.
I used to spin that bass to Michael prophet,
I used to think you wasnʼt popping till you had a stalker,
Iʼm not no alpha male,
Iʼm Carly Rae u Braden walker,
Look,
99 ainʼt a stack babe,
Say it 2x feel like Casanova,
Yʼall be praying to jehova,
I be praying to hova,
I Never whip or sold the Yola,
Still sold out the nova,
& thatʼs real to,
Donʼt rely on the strength of my image,
Hey!
If its good then its good,
break it down,
that shit is out of my hands.
Such a cool chord change!
Donʼt rely on the strength of mine,
Mine,
If its good then its good,
break it down,
that shit is out of my hands.
Quick sand's too thick to stand,
Go on and figure out now what it is that you need,
I'll step out for a minute to breath ,
One set of footsteps in the sand but I'm not being carried,
If it gets out of hand you can go on without me.<center></h3>
