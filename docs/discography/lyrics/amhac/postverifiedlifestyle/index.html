<center><h3 style="color:white">Iʼm feeling like fucking you up,
I still got the sig in the truck,
Iʼm treating this bitch like a cuck,
Blldddddd
Mac! Loading it up!
Hit your neck and your back and your front,
Circle round and send you to the sun,
I donʼt hide from you bums,
I survived thru the slums,
When u die theyʼll adjust,
Fuck it Iʼm breaking you off,
Bitch I came back with the hi point,
Cuz I know that you soft,
Never let em catch me slipping,
Keep my eyes wide like Kate Moss
[tears of a thot]
Letʼs get it!
You know when you get put on the spot,
But you donʼt know what to say,
Is that whatʼs happening now?
Donʼt worry about it,
Youʼll be ok,
Itʼs just something I grew up on,
We playing with pencils for fun?
We playing with pistols for fun,
Momma said donʼt rely on no gun,
Thatʼs why Iʼm fading you bums,
Labels say that Iʼm fatal to fund,
When I die
I want all my enemies
To take a sigh, and say RIP,
And everyone that I donʼt fuck with all of sudden start fucking with me,
Incredible,
Took an edible and thought my keyboard muttered to me,
Oh u think you up and coming G?
Naw up and comings really think they me,
Bitch Iʼm Beanie Sigel,
Mixed with Beatles,
with a dash a DOOM and 98 Degrees,
So fuck my PO I wonʼt take a plea,
I Bungie jumped into my destiny,
Post verified,
Cuz these niggas really think a handle could handle me,
Itʼs the young Black Ali G,
Falling off before I catch a fee,
Hit the mueller,
Let me down with ease baby,
How you gonna turn me on?<center></h3>
