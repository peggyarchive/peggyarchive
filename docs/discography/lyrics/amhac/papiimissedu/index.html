<center><h3 style="color:white">Niggas bold,
Bitches shady,
Records gold,
Cracker pay me,
Round here niggas really think shit gravy,
Black mʼs been got since the mid 80s,
Since a little baby,
Heard white folks like beer,
Rich young swan Iʼm a seer,
Fuck him he is not top tier,
And he never ever spit a fuckin rhyme that made me care,
Big strap looking like a dildo,
Looking like a creep when I kick door,
Young black male with the 44,
Iʼm a terrorist,
I donʼt spit raps bitch,
I spit rhetoric
& I be In your kids minds,
Getting leverage,
I hate white old Niggas,
Iʼm prejudice,
But im a take u niggas money,
like a reverend,
Better then me rather than you,
Iʼma bury it,
Tryna lead these niggas to freedom peggy Harriet,
Target practice on a aryan,
Redneck tears,
Woooo What A beverage.
Dead cops on my songs that hilarious!
Are u mad cuz nigga done bought a gold tooth?
Are u mad when u see me up in your Whole Foods?
Man these fake young dolphs think they bulletproof,
Niggas bold,
Bitches shady,
Records gold,
Cracker pay me,
Round here niggas really think shit gravy,
Black ms been got since the mid 80s,
Bitch im on yo street right now,
Creep up turn lights then out,
Ima how u what this hype bout,
I Know,
Bowling for the Columbine,
Heard he want the nicotine,
sig up on his chin it make him move like pistol Pete,
Flash the burner is his face and make him pray to me,
[redacted]
Fuck with me you gon end up like Dylan RoOf Fuck with me u gon end up like steve,
paddock,
Hunched over nigga they thought u was a hammock,
these clips spit they taking out yo fam lay,
We pack tools but We ainʼt going camping,
Big cannon on me bitch Iʼm the young cammy,
SJWʼs cannot fucking stand me,
I canʼt coddle u I am not your mami,
Stick in my head like I am Bambi,
Ugh...
I never stick the landing,
Throwing bullets at you I think Iʼm Peyton Manning,
Gloc real ugly I call it steve Bannon,
Caught him at a show and got to fucking clapping,
12 pull up and I donʼt what happened,
Iʼm just rapping baby.<center></h3>
