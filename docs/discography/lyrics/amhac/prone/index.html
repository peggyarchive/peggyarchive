<center><h3 style="color:white">Since you be alone,
Catch this heat alone,
Fuck Yo niggas Holmes,
They gonʼ be alone,
P94.
Leave that nigga prone,
Now u wanna start,
Big shit nigga now u wanna bark,
Get the things,
Let It spark,
Peg lord should of died in the aughts,
Yea,
I ainʼt gotta talk,
When I see him,
Iʼma send him to the lord,
One click we gon empty his cart,
Plant feet take charge,
We canʼt find you at your job,
We gon be at home,
Heard that nigga up and coming,
We gon put him on,
I ainʼt even gon try to conceal the chrome,
Letʼs get it on,
Now get him gone,
Bullet hit his neck and his backbone,
...filters no stock in,
One shot turn Steve Brannon into Steve hawking,
Since u be alone,
Catch this heat alone,
Fuck yo niggas homes,
They gon be alone,
P94
Leave the nigga prone,
[somebody likes me!]
Its the ocean,
And the trees,
And the birds,
And the bears,
Damn,
OMG,
Got somebody,
Sheʼs a beauty,
a beauty,
Very special,
Really and truly,
And truly..<center></h3>
