<center><h3 style="color:white">Itʼs a cycle, go in like Bobby
End up like Michael,
I guess that itʼs just a vicious cycle,
Go in like Bobby end up like..
Itʼs like a cycle, ugh,
I feel like Sam Zayn,
My moves been making waves,
Tell the writers write me a title,
2 guns like Lara Croft,
I look like Herman Cain,
I dress like Jimmy john,
Baby we gon pull you apart,
Real estate in your skin,
Iʼll break A hateful heart,
I know these cracker a&rʼs,
Think Iʼm ala-cart,
They want me Kevin James,
Bitch pay me like Kevin hart,
Mmmmm...
letʼs the kids crown me king for this art!
I canʼt behave myself.
Itʼs like a cycle,
Heard Peggy selling out,
He got a whip a house,
I guess itʼs just a vicious cycle,
Go in like Bobby,
End up like Michael,
Then donʼt come around.
They playing with my name,
Young Peggy bring the pain,
I click a bitch,
Iʼm adam Sandler
Bringing major Payne,
Damien Wayne,
Iʼm the progidal son,
Forced my way in the game,
I coulda reached for the pub,
And ended up like acclaim,
I got booked for Coachella,
Enemies canʼt say the same,
I been beefing with bums,
I should find heathlier game,
I skin a fucking rapper,
Perfect pelt bogus chain,
Nigga pretend to be Peggy,
But canʼt master the range,
These boys be **** on twitter,
And think they bringing change,
I think they full of shit,
Some people feel the same,
Some people need a hero,
My niggas need a bane,
Oooh like a baby,
Fresh out the womb,
No towel!
Iʼm so feable,
Iʼm evil,
Donʼt treat me like no child babe!<center></h3>
