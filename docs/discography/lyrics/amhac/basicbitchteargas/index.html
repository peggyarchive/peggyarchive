<center><h3 style="color:white">A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly,
And also known as a busta (busta),
Always talkin' about what he wants,
And just sits on his broke ass,
So no, I don't want your number,
No, I don't want to give you mine and,
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere,
No, I don't want none of it...
a scrub checkin' me,
But his game is kinda weak,
And I know that he cannot approach me,
I'm looking like class, and he's looking like trash,
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass so,
I donʼt want no scrubs,
Scrubs is a guy that canʼt get no love from me
It ainʼt hard to see..<center></h3>
