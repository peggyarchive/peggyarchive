I wanna be your girl,
You wanna take me out,
Yay yay,
Take me out,
Huh!
They wanna take my down,
They never take my crown,
Bitch No!
Hate?

Bitch where?
Bruh put keyboard down,
Get the Mac out,
Black out make a motherfucker back out
back out,
Gs up freeze up when I Put it down,
Iʼm pulling up on this pussy And Iʼm pulling out,
Rock bottom when I put it down,
You it those clowns,
Switch your pitch when I hit the mound,
Rap niggas think they so profound,
Got em looking up at who they under now
I ainʼt underground,
Bitch Iʼm over who you under now,
Sucka!
Hope you had the time of your life,
Cuz itʼs over for you when I come around,
Thot tactics!
Yo shit donʼt bump,
You is not proactive,
Sneak dissin,
That is not attractive!
Iʼm in slump but Iʼm bouncing back bitch bitch,
Crash whips like burnout pussy Nigga how u end up caught in traffic,
Chrome ratchet case basket,
With white shooters like the old Mavericks,
its real.
I wanna rock yo world,
I wanna be your girl,
You wanna take me out,
Yay yay,
Take me out,
Huh!
They wanna take my down,
They never take my crown,
Bitch No!

Did me,
No apologies.<center></h3>
