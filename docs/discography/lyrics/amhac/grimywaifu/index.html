<center><h3 style="color:white">These bullets coming at you,
Take these bullets for me thatʼs my Grimy Waifu,
Hot.
They keep on dumping the tool,
Take those bullets for me thatʼs my oh,
Whoa!
These bullets coming at you,
Take these bullets for me thatʼs my Grimy Waifu,
Hot.
They steady dumping the tool,
Take those bullets for me thatʼs my...
I ainʼt got no Birken bags,
Fucking with me you gonʼ get
The price or tap,
Music biz donʼt give no pat on the backs,
Stack it up stack it up stack it up,
Pack it up pack it up pack it up,
Grown!
Live at the days inn,
My appetite make me nauseuous,
They thinking tinder with the topic,
So Iʼm catious,
I take the wins out with the losses,
You see me gripping with gossip,
Now Iʼm eating dinner with bosses,
I hit the vape because itʼs needed,
I fall sleep like Tempur-Pedic,
Gotta light gotta light gotta light
Iʼll be there,
They kill my niggas for no reason!
These bullets coming at you,
Take these bullets for me thatʼs my Grimy Waifu,
Hot.
I keep the peach in my juul,
Take those bullets for me thatʼs my grimy Waifu!<center></h3>
