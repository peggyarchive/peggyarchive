<center><h3 style="color:white">Man I really really wish I was iIlluminati,
Niggas waiting on the peg like Iʼm dropping yahndi,
Too black too strong, im a little thotty,
But fuck a big speech,
Cuz when Iʼm rolling,
Iʼm dressing up like Iʼm prince peach,
And if you sending them Marioʼs to defend me,
U better make sure they break all the Grammys
kill all the winners losers and nominees,
Off probation,
Crackers hating,
Accusations,
Only on occasions,
I donʼt want relations,
Had some thotty phases,
Strip home invasion,
Fuck with me man,
Yʼall better miss me,
Cuz if you rolling,
Iʼm stoning niggas like rich Keith,
And when Iʼm whipping you niggas itʼs not slavery,
Iʼm on a mission to slaughter the completion
And leave them slumped on the downbeat,
Bitch work!
Or how we gonna make this bullshit work,
How we gonna make this work,
How can I make a good beat,
I get nervous when niggas want features,
I get nervous,
I donʼt know this,
I donʼt know this.
Bitch I came back with jak and Dax off the shelf!
Shopping my target,
Im wishing you well,
I donʼt think prayer can help,
This feel like kenan & kel,
These niggas broke like a dell,
Nigga tell,
Niggas melt,
Iʼma shoot,
You donʼt sell,
I donʼt think prayers or poems or nothing can help<center></h3>
